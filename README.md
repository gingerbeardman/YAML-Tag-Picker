YAML Tag Picker is an extension for the [Nova editor](https://nova.app).

Easily select tags for the YAML front matter in your blog posts. It scans your existing posts for tags and presents them in a Choice Palette, making it easy to maintain consistent tagging across your blog.

See the internal [README](/YAML%20Tag%20Picker.novaextension/README.md) for more info.
