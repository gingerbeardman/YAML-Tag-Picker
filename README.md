# YAML Tag Picker

YAML Tag Picker is an extension for the [Nova editor](https://nova.app).

Easily select tags for the YAML front matter in your blog posts. It scans your existing posts for tags and presents them in a Choice Palette, making it easy to maintain consistent tagging across your blog.

You can select multiple tags one after another; when you're done choose "Finish Selection" or press `Esc`.

See the internal [README](/YAML%20Tag%20Picker.novaextension/README.md) for more info.

Recommended download from [Nova Extensions](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/com.gingerbeardman/com.gingerbeardman.YAMLTagPicker/) website.
